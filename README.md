# PSA Tech Team & Small Filipino Business Database


> **Location and time subject to change**

## Overview

### PSA Tech Team
**Tech Team Thursdays** are recurring events where we come together to develop technology-driven projects that benefit **PSA** and its members. We will primarily focus on software development, mainly web development, but if you’re a tech enthusiast, an engineer, or just curious about the world of technology, we’d love to have you join us!

Our goals include:
- **Empowering Members:** Equipping students with technical skills in web development, programming, and project management through workshops and real-world projects.
- **Enhancing PSA's Digital Presence:** Developing projects that improve PSA's online platforms and community engagement.

The PSA Tech Team holds regular meetings where members learn various aspects of web development, including **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React**, and collaborate on exciting projects to gain practical experience.

### Small Filipino Business Database
The **Small Filipino Business Database** is one of the ongoing projects developed by the PSA Tech Team. It aims to catalog and highlight Filipino-owned businesses, making it easier for the community to discover and support them. The database will serve as a resource for those interested in finding local Filipino-run businesses and fostering economic growth within the community.

#### Project Goals
- **Build a User-Friendly Platform:** Create a website where users can search, filter, and view Filipino-owned businesses with ease.
- **Empower Filipino Entrepreneurs:** Provide a platform for small businesses to gain visibility and reach a broader audience.
- **Community Connection:** Strengthen ties within the Filipino community by encouraging support for local enterprises.

#### Project Features
The project is built with a **React** front-end and a **MySQL** back-end, with plans for further development, including:
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Allow users to search for businesses based on location, type, or name.
- **Map Integration:** Display businesses on an interactive map using the **Google Maps API**.
- **User-Submitted Data:** Encourage users to add or update information on local businesses.
